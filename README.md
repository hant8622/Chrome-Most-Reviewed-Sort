### Usage
Please make sure you're viewing your search results within Google Maps before clicking the button to sort. The sort feature will NOT work if users do not have a searched result ready or if they aren't on Google Maps at all.

To start fresh and clear your current list of sorted places, simply click the "Reset" button.

**Before searching for new places or exploring different areas, remember to click the "Reset" button to clear your previous results and ensure accurate sorting.**

While still in Google Maps, clicking on a place listed in the extension will conveniently redirect you to that location's details within Google Maps.

This extension remembers your sorted places until you click "Reset". If you're not on Google Maps and click a saved place from the extension, it will open a new Google Maps tab and display that specific location.
